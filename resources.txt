I used UC Davis UoC Waterhouse Lab (http://waterhouse.ucdavis.edu/), Practical Winery & Vineyard Journal (https://www.practicalwinery.com/) and the Australian Wine Research Institute (https://www.awri.com.au/) websites as sources of further information for insights into the variables contained in the wine dataset and how they might contribute to the quality score or relate to each other.  
 
Various other sources were used in my research for things like creating new categorical labels or better understanding relationships between variables. I have itemized the source and its use purpose in the list below.  

Additional resources

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetness_of_wine : Used to create the categorical variable Sweet
* http://chemistry.elmhurst.edu/vchembook/184ph.html : Understanding pH
* https://www.reference.com/science/ph-level-sugar-b4748abdf49c1d6b : Understanding pH of sugar


Modeling resource
* http://little-book-of-r-for-multivariate-analysis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/multivariateanalysis.html  used for code relating to the prediction model. Note: the code used is cited inline in the RMD file as well.
